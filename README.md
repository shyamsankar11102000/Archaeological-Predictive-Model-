This project compares two pattern recognition techniques—logistic regression and decision trees—by implementing Archaeological Predictive Models (APM) using datasets from two distinct regions: Upper Galilee in northern Israel and Fuxin in northeast China. The goal is to assess the effectiveness of each model in predicting archaeological sites based on environmental features like proximity to water, slope, and elevation, which influenced ancient settlement patterns. In the Galilee, features like distance to springs and land curvature were key, while in Fuxin, proximity to rivers, crops, and elevation played a crucial role. The decision tree model outperformed logistic regression in most evaluation metrics, achieving 83% classification accuracy and a higher precision of 0.64, compared to logistic regression's performance. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) for the decision tree model was 0.84, demonstrating its effectiveness in spatial prediction. However, the model's generalization could improve with more data from different regions.
